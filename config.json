  "description": "A multi-agent system that classifies support tickets and drafts responses using a knowledge base.",
  "overview": "The 'support_ticket_resolver' blueprint streamlines customer service by automating the support ticket handling process. It starts with the `ticket_classifier`, which categorizes incoming tickets into types such as billing, technical, or general. Based on this classification, the `kb_retriever` agent searches the internal knowledge base to find the most relevant article or troubleshooting information. The `ticket_responder` then drafts a customized response to the customer using the classification and retrieved content. This automation improves response time, consistency, and customer satisfaction while reducing manual workload for support teams.",
